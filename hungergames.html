			<h2 class="hg_heading">Mrs.Everdeen's Brother</h2>
			<p class="facts">
				Not many people know this, but Mrs. Everdeen wasn't the only child in her family. She was the younger sister of a boy, with a blonde hair, blue eyes and a fiery spirit. She loved her brother deeply, and nothing pierced her heart more than when both her older brother and her best friend were reaped. Her brother protected her best friend but in the end it wasn't enough. Not long after the canon that sounded the end of her best friend's life, he was crowded victor. By the time he got back, Mrs.Everdeen had already fallen in love and married Mr.Everdeen, which is why she wasn't killed by Snows wrath. Haymitch knew it was too risky to seek out to his little sister, offering her nothing more than a polite, sad smile over the years. He yearned to do more, especially after he saw how thin and frail her and her daughters were. In honor of their safety though, he admired and loved their family from afar. But in the end, it wasn't enough. Because as he would tell his niece, no one ever really wins the games. So when Primrose was reaped, and Katniss volunteered, he pledged to save her. Because he knew that his younger sister couldn't lose to another person, whether it be to the games or those wretched coal mines.

			<p class="facts">
				In the 10th Hunger Games, 15 tribute were killed in the bloodbath, the most ever since the Games started. The arena was designed as a foggy swap, which didn't suit anyone's skills. The first day, a total of 19 tributes were killed. Mags, a then 18 year old girl, quickly found materials that led to her victory. At the Cornucopia, she snapped up a bow. With great luck, she spotted a deer eating leaves in a bush. As she lift her bow, the deer suddenly dropped dead. Mags ran over and found the leaves hanging out of its mouth, and she realised that the leaves were poisonous. Not long after, she heard a beeping noise, and watched a parachute drop down not far from her. She ran to the tribute and shot him through the heart before he could retrieve the parachute. She found bread rolls in the parachute, and quickly put her plan to action. She stuffed the bread with the poisonous leaves and sent the parachutes down from the top of trees, and watched the other tributes die from the food they thought would save their lives. After two days, the 23 other tributes were viped out, and Mags was crowned victor. A week after returning home, she found her parents and fiance dead. A note was left that read, "You will never stop paying for this."

				Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena.

			<h2 class="hg_heading">Interview</h2>
			<p class="facts">
				During his interview with Caesar Flickerman, Haymitch is asked about what he thinks of the Games having 100% as many tributes; he replies by saying he doesn't see much difference as they are still going to be 100% as stupid, a display of his own wit.
			</p>
			<h2 class="hg_heading">Cornucopia Bloodbath</h2>
			<p class="facts">
				When the bloodbath of the 50th Hunger Games took place, many tributes were amazed by the beautiful arena, and many of the tributes were too stunned to get off their pedestals. Therefore, Haymitch was able to easily get a knife and a "backpack of choice" from the Cornucopia.

			<h2 class="hg_heading">The Pin</h2>
			<p class="facts">
				The pin originally belonged to Madge Undersee's aunt, Maysilee Donner, a tribute who dies in the 50th Hunger Games. When Katniss first saw Madge wearing the pin, she thought that it could keep a family fed with bread for months due to the fact that it is made of finely crafted gold. When Madge came to bid Katniss farewell she offered it to her as a symbol of District 12 and made her promise to wear it in the arena, although in the movie, Katniss got it from Greasy Sae. Cinna later affixed it to Katniss' shirt while they were in the Launch Room, as Katniss had completely forgotten about it. He revealed that it had barely passed the review board because the Gamemakers thought the point could be used as a weapon.<br>Rue, who had a special relationship with the Mockingjays back in the Disetrict 11, decided that she could trust Katniss after seeing her wear the pin.

			<h2 class="hg_heading">Katniss is named after a plant</h2>
			<p class="facts">
				Katniss was a born archer. Her name came later, while I was researching survival training and specifivally edible plants. In one of my books, I found the arrowhead plant, and the more I read about it, the more it seemed to reflect her." Collins told The New York Times in 2018.<br>
				"Its Latin name has the same roots as Sagittarius, the archer," she explained. "The edible tuber roots she could gather, the arrowhead-shaped leaves were her defense, and the little white blossoms kept it in the tradition of other characters' flower names, like Rue and Primrose."

				The sun was slowly starting to set in the horizon of the sea that was now glimmering with the colors of red and orange. The sand was warm and soft, and a gentle blow of wind brushed over the two lovers that sat on the beach, side by side. The girl was resting her head on the boy’s shoulder, gazing into the sunset. It was peaceful. The boy looked down at the girl next to her, his eyes shining with something that could be nothing else but love. “Annie?” The boy said. The girl stopped resting her head over the boy’s shoulder: “Yeah?”<br>The boy turned to face the girl, starting to reach something from his pocket with a smile. “I wan’t to give you something.” The girl, Annie, sat up more straight with curiosity taking over her facial expression. She then smirked and said: “Finnick, you know that my birthday is six months away, right?” And the boy, Finnick, laughed. His fingers were wrapped around something quite small, and Annie let herself be curious again. “So, what is it?”<br>Finnick opened his fist and Annie leaned towards him to see better: it was a necklace. A golden necklace shaped like a small heart - and it had a carving on it. It said ‘For all eternity’ in a beautiful handwriting. “Finnick,” Annie sighed, and Finnick smiled sheepisly. He wiped the necklace with his thumb and said: “I got it done with my own instructions. The last time I was at the Capitol.” Annie smiled as she gently took the necklace in her own fingers to look at it more better.<br>“But why?” She asked. They rarely bought each other presents, except on birthdays and some other special occasions. Finnick smiled the smile Annie so much loved, the smile she had fallen in love with.<br>“It’s because I love you more than I’ve ever loved anything. And because, Annie, you’ve got my heart. We’ve been trough a hell and back together, and still, we’re here. No matter where I am, no matter when, no matter why, you’ve always had and will have my heart. For all eternity,” Finnick said, and word by word, Annie’s eyes started slowly glistening with tears she tried to hold in. But before Finnick got in the midway of his speech, the tears were rolling down her cheeks like there’s no tomorrow. “Finn, I love you too. More than I’ve ever loved anything,” she whispered, rose on her knees and wrapped her arms around Finnick’s neck.<br>The time seemed to froze on that very moment, as the sea-green eyes met each other. Finnick smiled before he pressed his lips onto Annie’s, locking his arms around her waist. After a while they just sat there, their foreheads against each other, eyes closed. “For all eternity,” Finnick whispered.
			</p>
			<p class="facts">
				Now, four years later, Annie Cresta was alone in front of a television. It was the interviews of the annual 75th Hunger Games, and right now, Finnick Odair was being interviewed. Annie knew him better than anyone. And by looking at his eyes, she could tell that he had something on his mind. One last thing he wanted to say - and Caesar Flickerman, the scarily joyful host, gave him the chance to say it by asking about one special someone, which Finnick responded with a smile that was obviously faked.<br>Finnick took a deep breath, turned his out straight towards the camera and stared into Annie’s eyes. “My love,” he started with slightly shaky voice, “you have my heart. For all eternity. And if I die on that arena, my last thought will be of your lips.” There was one tear. One, lonely tear rolling down his cheek as he stared into her eyes with great desperation. And in his sea-green eyes, Annie could see it all.<br>The day Finnick met Annie. He was 12, Annie was 10. She was quite shy, and he said that her name was pretty. After that day, their lives had been intertwined just like they would’ve been destined to. The memories went trough his eyes so fast, the sounds, the words all blurr. The day he got reaped. Their first kiss when Annie was 14. Their silly dancing in the pouring rain. The first time Finnick said ‘I love you’. The day she got reaped. All the kisses. All the hugs. All the laughter. All of the love. Their eternity.<br>And again, tears were rolling down her cheeks like there was no tomorrow. Finnick was still staring straight into her eyes, and Annie wasn’t quite sure if she could breathe. Her fingers wrapped around the golden necklace, and trough the tears, trough the memories, she was able to whisper: “For all eternity.”
