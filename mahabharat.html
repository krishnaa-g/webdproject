			<section><h2>BARBARIKA – GRANDSON OF BHIMA</h2>
			<p>Barbareek/Barbarika is one of the sons of the Asura Putra of Bheem, Ghatothkach. Even though he wasn’t the most powerful or the mightiest warrior of his time, he happened to have not ONE of the most powerful weapons, but three. He had the three infallible arrows which was granted to him by Mahadev, and the bow which was bestowed to him by Agni Deva. It was so powerful that the three arrows alone could destroy humanity. </p>
			<p>So you can see that if he had participated in the war along with the Pandavas then he could have destroyed the entire Kauravas in a minute. In fact he wanted to join the war, but he wanted to join the side that was weaker, that is, the one with the less number of army factions(less Akshauhinis). That was a oath he took. That means it should be fulfilled.</p>
			<p>The problem was that, if he joined the Pandavas and destroy the Kauravas then the Kauravas will become the weaker side and 	hence he would have to destroy the Pandavas also, leaving no man at the end of the war but him.</p>
			<p>So when Krishna told him about this consequence and advised him to stay away from the war, he could not oblige as it was an oath he took. The only solution to this was that that he should die. So Krishna requested him to be allowed to slay off his head so as to fix the problem. Barbarika was happy to be able to be of a use to his grandfathers (Pandavas) and Krishna, but on a condition that he should be able to watch the whole Mahabharata even after he was beheaded. And hence it was done. He was one the people who got the opportunity to watch the whole war. His case was a bit special as he was able to watch the war with his eyes even after his head was detached from his body. His head was kept on a mountain somewhere near to the Kurukshetra so that he could comfortably watch the war.</p><br></section>

			<section><h2>FIRST READING OF MAHABHARAT</h2>
			<p>Vaishampayana, the disciple of Vedvyas read Mahabharat for the first time, in the House of the King Janamejaya who was the grandson of Abhimanyu and son of Parikshit. Many Sarpyaga were done by him to take the revenge of his father’s death.</p></section><br>
			<section><h2>ARJUNA, DURYODHAN AND THE FIVE GOLDEN ARROWS</h2>
			<p>Duryodhana had gone to Dwaita forest to humiliate the Pandavas with all the servants from Indraprastha. There a Gandharava by the name Chitrasena, and his apsaras were enjoying in the pond. Duryodhana asked Chitrasena to abandon the pool but as he refused, a heated argument broke out between them. Chitrasena attacked Duryodhana.</p>
			<p>The Pandavas who were nearby asked Chitrasena to let Duryodhana alone. Chitrasena who was a friend of Arjuna spared Duryodhana but not before tying him with vines and setting him on his horse. Duryodhana though humiliated, thanked Arjuna and asked him what he wanted for the turn he had done to him. Arjuna said that he would ask from Duryodhana some other time.</p>
			<p>At the time of war, Bhishma, who was on the side of Kauravas was accused by Duryodhana for doing no harm to the Pandavas and favoring them. On hearing this, Bhishma became very angry and in his anger, he took five golden arrows and filled it with mantras.</p>
			<p>He vowed that the Pandavas would die before the Sunset. But Duryodhana suspected that Bhishma would never do anything which would harm the Pandavas. So, he took those arrows with him.</p>
			<p>Lord Krishna reminded Arjun that Duryodhana had promised him of boon and he should ask him for the five golden arrows. When Arjun asked him about the arrows Duryodhana was shocked and asked him how did he know about those arrows then Arjun replied “Krishna”.</p><br></section>

			<section><h2>SARVADA-SON OF BHIMA</h2>
			<p>Bhima had one surviving son named Sarvaga by Balandhara, who was not given the throne despite being much elder to Parikshit. He became the ruler of Kashi (his mother’s land) instead.It is curious that Sarvada did not fight the Mahabharata war while King of Kashi fought for the Pandavas. While Abhimanyu was killed in the war, Sarvada's non-participation may have removed him from contention to the throne of Hastinapur.</p>
			<p>It is possible that since the King of Kashi may not have had male heirs, he was chosen as the male heir to the royal lineage and abdicated his right to the throne of Hastinapur.</p>
			<p>It is also possible that ruling over large empires was difficult in olden days and for the purpose of good governance kingdoms respected each others boundaries.</p></section>
			<section><h2>EKALAVYA - POST-DRONA SAGA</h2>
			<p>Ekalavya was actually Krishna’s cousin. He was the son of Devashrava (brother of Vasudeva) who got lost in the forest and was found by a Nishada Hiranyadhanu. Ekalavya died protecting his father during Rukmini Swayamvar. He was killed by Krishna. For his great sacrifice of Gurudakshina, Krishna blessed Ekalavya that he would be soon reincarnated and take revenge on Drona. This person was Dhristadyumna.</p></section>
			<section><h2>DID VIDURA POSSESS THE MOST POWERFUL EVER WEAPON?</h2>
			<p>We all know that Krishna came to Hastinapur on behalf of the Pandavas for peace negotiation.
			He had a warm welcome from the Kaurava side (extraordinary archery welcome from Karna).
			He disappointed Duryodana by refusing his request to stay in the house arranged by him and told him that he will stay along with Vidura’s family for the entire duration of visit. He already knew that Duryodana would have arranged someone to monitor Krishna’s activity in his palace if Krishna accepted to stay in. So he decided to go for an alternative.</p>
			<p>The very next day during the time of peace negotiation, Duryodana abuses Vidura for giving Krishna(their enemy) a place to stay , with harsh words, accusing him of partiality and favoring Pandavas' side, forgetting that Vidura was an elder in the family and his own paternal uncle.</p>
			<p>After a point of time, Vidura's rage exceeded when he heard Duryodana abusing him on the basis of his birth and cast aspersions on the character of Vidura's mother as well.</p>
			<p>Immediately he burst out like thunder, taking out his bow and arrow, aiming at Duryodhana.
			But Krishna cleverly intervened and played a trick. Turning towards Duryodhana, he said,
			 “O Kaurava king, do not provoke Vidura like this. If you do, he might break his bow and declare that he will not fight on your side and would be neutral.”</p>
			<p>Duryodhana, however, was still indignant and arrogant and said it did not matter if Vidura decided against fighting.“ Without his help, I (Duryodhana) can win the war.” 
			At last, an enraged Vidura was unable to digest any further insult. He declared, “Krishna, you guided me on the right path and reminded me of my power of archery. I will fight no more.” 
			So saying, he strung his bow and broke it with a thunderous noise accompanied by a flash of lightning, Vidura thanked Krishna and walked out of the durbar.

			<section><h2>IRAVAN-SON OF ARJUN</h2>
			<p>To ensure victory, the sages advised the Pandavas to sacrifice a man who had 32 Sacred Marks on his body to Kaali. Only 3 Man had such marks on Pandavas Side- Krishna, Arjun and Iravan. Iravan was the son of Arjun and Ulupi, a Naga Princess. Arjun asked him to devote himself for this Sacrifice to which Iravan agreed. However he had a condition that he wanted to marry a woman, so that she will weep on his death. Krishna turned himself to the beautiful Mohini. That night they made love and the next day he was sacrificed to Kaali. Mohini wept for him so much that it is said no woman had ever wept so much on their husband's death</p></section>
			<section><h2>HOW ARJUN ALMOST DIED</h2>
			<p>Arjuna had a son named Babruvahana with Chitrangada, the princess of Manipur. When the Pandavas were performing the Aswamedha Yagna, it was stopped by Babruvahana when it entered Manipur. After hours of fight, the unthinkable happened. Arjuna fell to death. This happened because, Arjuna had killed Bhishma, who was like his father. So Bhisma's mother, Ganga cursed him that he would die at the hands of his son.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, there appeared another wife of Arjun, Ulupi, who was a Naga Princess. She revived him with her Naga Maani. Arjuna was brought to life again. But he didn't recognised Ulupi. She was so heartbroken, she left and went away.</p></section><br>

			<section><h2>DRAUPADI’S PLEA TO SHIVA</h2>
			<p>Shiva was really scared because he knew what Draupadi asked for, was actually possible but this will disturb the very happening of Mahabharat. He kept quiet for a while and then told her that it was just impossible. What she was asking for, was not possible for him to give it to her as a boon. Draupadi was not happy with Shiva.</p>
			<p>Shiva promised her that he will instead give her five men with five qualities with one quality in each. In this way,she will get what she wanted. Draupadi told that she wanted all qualities in single person. She had given her soul to such a man.If she would not get her boon,she will not be happy with Shiva.</p>
			<p>Shiva told Draupadi that man is a human.He can possess only certain qualities.He cannot have all qualities. This was impossible.If he have it all,where would he put those qualities? What she was asking for, was against the rules of nature. Shiva tried to convince her and asked her to accept those five men because she had asked for them actually. It is her mistake to ask for a boon which was not present with Lord Shiva.</p>
				<h3>1.A Great Archer</h3>
				<p>There was a great fight going on between Karna and Arjun in Mahabharata. Arjun hit an arrow on Karna's chariot and pushed it three steps back. Karna hit Arjun's chariot with an arrow and pushed it half step back. Arjun was really happy. Krishna was smiling at Arjun. Krishna told him that the entire Universe resides in him and he was sitting on his chariot while there was no one on Karna's chariot. He(Karna) just pushed his chariot half step back. This means he had the power to move this Universe.Why he(Arjun) was smiling?Krishna told him that he did lie nowhere as compared to Karna. He(Karna) was a great warrior.</p>
				<p> because he gave a word to her, not to kill them.If he had not given a word to her,they would not be alive.He just wanted to kill Arjun.</p>
				<h3>2.A Great Mace Fighter</h3>
				<p>Karna and Bhima fought for entire day in Mahabharata. Both fought very well but at last, Bhima lost the fight with Karna. Karna did not kill him because of the word he gave to his mother Kunti,not to kill her four sons.</p>
				<h3>3.A Man of Great Patience</h3>
				<p>Karna,during his learning days,did bear the sting of poisonous crab resulting in great pain.When Parshuram sage came to know that he lied to him that he was Brahman,he gave him a curse that Karna will forget all what he learnt when he will fight his important war. Parshuram called him a warrior, not Brahmin as Brahmin can never bear such a pain.</p>
				<p>Sahadev had the gift of forseeing the future, under the condition that he can't tell it to anyone, ANYONE. So he was so patient and had to bear it all himself as he already know that Mahabharat was coming, and they are going to lose everything they hold dear.</p>
				<h3>4.A Beautiful Man by Face</h3>
				<p>Karna was actually a beautiful person physically and mentally.Even Krishna called him beautiful and told him that even time can stop to see his beauty for a while.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, Nakul is also said to be one of the most handsome men to have ever lived</p>
				<h3>5.A Symbol Of Dharma</h3>
				<p>Karna did what all he thought was his Karma. He knew everything about Dharma and Karma. He knew that Kauravas were going to lose the battle but still he chose to fight from the losing side as freedom of debt was more important for him than victory. He died to clear the debts of Duryodhana on him.</p>
			<p>So, ideally Karna was the man Draupadi was praying to Shiva, to be her husband. But if Karna becomes the husband of Draupadi, there is no point in Krishna's avatar. And that's how and why Draupadi got her five husbands</p></section>
